## Description
This was a difficult challenge, but I truly enjoyed the challenge of updating my portfolio. During this update of my portfolio I utilized bootstrap a great deal more than I did the first time making the portfolio. I implemented bootstrap to help insert a navbar at the top of the page. Furthermore I used bootstrap to develop the jumbotron section with an image background from my first portfolio. Lastly I used bootstrap to help set up the rows and columns of the main section with each seperate section consitiing of: About me, work, resume, and contact information. I also used CSS to add a customized color gradient to the background of the webpage.
